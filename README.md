# VRon-Project
A repository for the VRonGlove, an advanced haptic motion tracking glove for OpenGloves.

This project has been introduced to the OpenGloves Community on Discord and is functional with OpenGloves to use in supported VR Games

Meanwhile, here is a picture that I made when I was working on an old prototype.

The original Unreal Engine 4 Project to use my ESP script for motion capture or force feedback tests is only avaible by sending me a message, as its too big for GitHub.
