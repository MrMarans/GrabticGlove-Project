# GrabticGlove-Project
A repository for the GrabticGlove, an advanced haptic motion tracking glove for OpenGloves.

Files for the designs, instructions and code are coming right before the final presentation of my master thesis. The reason is to not trigger any copyright questions because the source of my thesis is already somewhere online.

Meanwhile, here is a picture that I made when I was working on an old prototype.
